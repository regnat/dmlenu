(** Function to be called whenever the input is modified to recompute
    candidates. It will reset the selected candidates too. *)

(** Add a char to the current input. If the char is a separator and we

(** Tries to complete the current selected candidate. Returns true whenever we moved to a new token. *)

(** Moves the current selection to the left *)

(** Moves the current selection to the right *)
(** Moves right *)

(** Moves the current selection to the up *)

val down : t -> t
(** Moves the current selection to the down *)

(** Moves the current selection to the up (by one page) *)

(** Simulate a backspace. The boolean tells you whether the current token has changed *)

(** Returns the value of all tokens currently accumulated *)

(** Normalize the pagination for candidates *)
